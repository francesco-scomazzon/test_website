  <h1> Are European countries reducing caesarean sections? </h1>
  
  <p>In 1985 the World Health Organization recommended that cesarean sections must not exceed 15% of the total child births.  However, as of  2021, most European countries haven’t met this criteria. </p>
 
  <h2> Why is this relevant? </h2>
  <p> Cesarean section affects the development of the immunity system of the babies and it 	increases the risk of allergies and atopic diseases, such as eczema and asthma. This is because, when a Cesarean section is performed, it interrupts and modifies the development of intestinal microbiota in babies. </p>
  
  <h2> What is Microbiota? </h2>
  
  <p>Microbiota is actually a big deal! It is a multitude of organism, mostly bacteria, which populate our intestine. According to the science magazine—Focus, the population of intestinal microbiota is composed of more than ten times the number of cells in our body. Did you know that, until some years ago, microbiota was thought to be a real organ due to its weight. Its role is to help us digest food and protect from diseases. It does this by avoiding the colonization by other ingested microorganism.  </p>
  
  <h2> European trends in the paast decade </h2>
  
  <p> In this table we can see that Iceland and the Netherlands are the leading counties in Europe with 15% of babies born with cesarean section each year - as recommend by WHO. At the Botton of the table are Turkey and Cyprus, which currently rank the lowest with 61% and 54% respectively. </p>
  <p> The UK saw an increase of cesarean section by 5%. Alongside the UK, many southern European countries did even worse, for example the rates in Romania escalated from 34 to 44 %.
On the other hand, Italy has managed to cut them down by 10%. </p>

  <h2> Why does this matter now? </h2> 
  <p> Alongside the increase of cesarean sections, autoimmune diseases and allergies have risen. The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology states that allergy is the most common chronic disease in Europe. Up to 20% of patients with allergies live with a severe debilitating form of allergic condition. They struggle daily with the fear of a possible asthma attack, anaphylactic shock, or even death from an allergic reaction. To put this in perspective - at the beginning of the 20th century, allergy was seen as a rare disease. However, in the last few decades we have witnessed a dramatic increase in disease burden. Today, more than 150 million Europeans suffer from chronic allergic diseases and the current prediction show that by 2025 half of the entire EU population will be affected by allergies.  </p>
